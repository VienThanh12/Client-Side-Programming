    Example BMI - Activity 5 a and b - HTML parts

	BMI counter implemented as a dynamic web page with JavaScript.
    In addition to the calculated BMI, it shows the min and max BMI
    calculated. It is possible to select to save the previous height
    and weight and the min and max BMI. Saving is done using local storage.
    Local storage is emptied when saving is turned off.

    In this implementation, BMI is calculated as follows:
    BMI = weight / (height * height),
    where weight is in kilograms and height in meters.

    The logic in the JavaScript is as follows:
    When the page is loaded, it is checked if there are saved data
    in the local storage. If there is, they are shown and BMI is
    calculated based on them. Also, in this case, the radio button for
    saving is set to "Yes". 

    If there are no saved data, the height is set to 170 cm and weight to
    65 kg and the BMI is calculated based on them. Also, in this case,
    the radio button for saving is set to "No".

    The BMI is calculated everytime either the height or weight is changed.
    If the radio button for saving is set to "Yes", the data is also saved
    (height and weight every time and BMI if it is either min or max).

    In addition, when the radio button is switched to "Yes" the data is
    saved to thelocal strage and when it is switched to "No", the data
    is removed from the local storage.
